movie_0_0		In a distant land, there is a beautiful village inhabited by living... bombs./This village was once a peaceful place, where the people loved their king and had prosperous lives...
movie_0_1		But the envy of Gaxlon, one of the king's counselors, has just unsettled this tranquility.../Gaxlon wanted to rule the kingdom by himself, but as he wasn't really prepared for such task, he imprisoned Aldan, the king, so that he could forcibly extract "advice" on how to govern./As his minions captured the king, the 4 super bombs arrived and witnessed the terrible scene...
movie_0_2		Gaxlon was quick and ordered his minions to also attack the super bombs, but Aldan protected them with an ancient magic./Seeing that the super bombs couldn't be defeated, he then ordered his minions to imprison each one of them in a distant place... And then he began his reign of terror.
movie_0_3		As the super bombs were being taken to faraway places, Bomba Azul, the smartest of them, was able to trick his captor and escape.../He saw Bomba Vermelha being taken in the direction of the Tars Island, so he headed there to begin rescuing his friends...
